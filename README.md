ðŸš´ Machine Learning Project: Predicting Rented Bike Count ðŸš´


Iâ€™m excited to share my latest machine learning project where I developed models to predict the rented bike count using a comprehensive dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This project involved building and evaluating five different regression models to predict the rented bike count. By exploring various models, I aimed to identify the one with the best predictive performance.


ðŸ“ˆ Key Highlights:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for model building, including handling missing values and feature engineering.

- Model Building: Developed five regression models: Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR (Support Vector Regression), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each model using R-squared to determine their accuracy.


Best Model: The SVR model achieved the highest accuracy with the best R-squared value, indicating its superior performance in predicting the rented bike count.
